# (Optional)
# Elasticsearch host
# es_host: elasticsearch.example.com

# (Optional)
# Elasticsearch port
# es_port: 14900

# (Optional) Connect with SSL to Elasticsearch
#use_ssl: True

# (Optional) basic-auth username and password for Elasticsearch
#es_username: someusername

# (Required)
# Rule name, must be unique
name: Event spike

# (Required)
# Type of alert.
# the spike rule type compares the number of events within two sliding windows to each other
type: spike

# (Required)
# Index to search, wildcard supported
index: rpn_module_info*
field_value: messages

timestamp_type: unix_ms

# (Required one of _cur or _ref, spike specific)
# The minimum number of events that will trigger an alert
# For example, if there are only 2 events between 12:00 and 2:00, and 20 between 2:00 and 4:00
# _cur is 2 and _ref is 20, and the alert WILL fire because 20 is greater than threshold_cur
threshold_cur: 5
#threshold_ref: 5

# (Required, spike specific)
# The size of the window used to determine average event frequency
# We use two sliding windows each of size timeframe
# To measure the 'reference' rate and the current rate
timeframe:
  seconds: 30

# (Required, spike specific)
# The spike rule matches when the current window contains spike_height times more
# events than the reference window
spike_height: 1.2

# (Required, spike specific)
# The direction of the spike
# 'up' matches only spikes, 'down' matches only troughs
# 'both' matches both spikes and troughs
spike_type: "up"
query_key: module

# (Required)
# A list of Elasticsearch filters used for find events
# These filters are joined with AND and nested in a filtered query
# For more info: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html

- query:
    query_string:
#      query: "messages:* AND module: Skeleton"
      query: "messages:*"

# (Required)
# The alert is use when a match is found
