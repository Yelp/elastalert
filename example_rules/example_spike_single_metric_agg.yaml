# (Required one of _cur or _ref, spike specific)
# The minimum value of the aggregation that will trigger the alert
# For example, if we're tracking the average for a metric whose average is 0.4 between 12:00 and 2:00
# and 0.95 between 2:00 and 4:00 with spike_height set to 2 and threshhold_cur set to 0.9:
# _ref is 0.4 and _cur is 0.95, and the alert WILL fire
# because 0.95 is greater than threshold_cur (0.9) and (_ref * spike_height (.4 * 2))
threshold_cur: 0.9

# (Optional, min_doc_count)
# for rules using a per-term aggregation via query_key, the minimum number of events
# over the past buffer_time needed to update the spike tracker
min_doc_count: 5

# (Required, spike specific)
# The spike aggregation rule matches when the current window contains spike_height times higher aggregated value
# than the reference window
spike_height: 2

# (Required, spike specific)
# The direction of the spike
# 'up' matches only spikes, 'down' matches only troughs
# 'both' matches both spikes and troughs
