# Type of alert.
# the spike rule type compares the number of events within two sliding windows to each other
type: frequency

# Index to search, wildcard supported

# The minimum number of events to be used as a baseline
# For example, if there are only 2 eventss between 12:00 and 2:00, and 20 between 2:00 and 4:00
# This rule will ignore that 'spike', because the reference window did not meet the threshold of 5
num_events: 1

# The size of the window used to determine average event frequency
# We use two sliding windows each of size timeframe
# To measure the 'reference' rate and the current rate
timeframe:
  minutes: 5

# The spike rule matches when the current window contains spike_height times more
# events than the reference window
#spike_height: 1

# The direction of the spike
